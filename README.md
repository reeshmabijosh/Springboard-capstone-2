# Problem Statement
Ratings alone do not give a complete picture of the products we wish to purchase. So secondary option is looking at the reviews. Reviewâ€™s plays an important role in the decision-making process. If the number of reviews is less, it is easy to read and understand but what if there are thousands of reviews. So, the problem is How we can analyze great number of online reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Client: Amazon customers

This project will serve three purposes 

1.Help consumers to understand the sentiment of the review(Sentiment Analysis).

2.Help the consumers to get consumer feedback in the form of topics covered by the reviews without having to go through all of them(Topic Modeling. 

3.Enable consumers to quickly extract the summary of the reviews without reading the entirely(Text Summarization).
